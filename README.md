# Final
Shooting game
Player will shoot the target in the limited time to get high score.

Summary
In this game, player will control the gun by mouse and shoot the target in the limited time to get high score as much as they can. The target will keep moving in the game. When the player shoot the target, the target disappears and a new target appears. The size of the target will be random to increase the difficulty.

Component Parts
This game will have the gun control by mouse, moving target with random size and a simple background like some grasses. There will also have a timer and a score board to count playersâ€™ point.

When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:

Timeline
What did you do in each of the past four weeks?
Week 0: Write Proposal
Week 1: I created the target for the game. Also, if the mouse click the red point on the target will make the target disappear and reappear in a random location.
Week 2: I added the blue aiming for the cursor which could help player take aim. I also made a score board.
Week 3: I changed the target size and make it moving around. Then I set the chance for the game. The game will end at player missed 5 times.
Week 4: Present!

Challenges
This project for me is a big challenge. It is difficult to set the specific click point for the target. I want the target to disappear when player click the red part. Also, I speeded long time to make the large moving around.
