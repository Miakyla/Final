# Mikayla Zhang: Final project

## Shooting game

Player will shoot the target in the limited time to get a high score.

## Summary

In this game, the player will control the gun by mouse and shoot the target in the limited time to get a high score as much as they can. The target will keep moving in the game. When the player shoots the target, the target disappears and a new target appears. The size of the target will be random to increase the difficulty.

## Component Parts

This game will have gun control by mouse, moving target with random size and a simple background like some grasses. There will also have a timer and a scoreboard to count playersâ€™ point.


## Timeline

Week 0: Write Proposal 

Week 1: I created the target for the game. Also, if the mouse clicks the red point on the target will make the target disappear and reappear in a random location. 

Week 2: I added the blue aiming for the cursor which could help the player take aim. I also made a scoreboard. 

Week 3: I changed the target size and make it moving around. Then I set the chance for the game. The game will end at player missed 5 times. 

Week 4: Present!

## Challenges

This project for me is a big challenge. It is difficult to set the specific click point for the target. I want the target to disappear when the player clicks the red part. Also, I speeded a long time to make the large moving around.
